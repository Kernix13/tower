# Tower Custom WordPress Theme

This is the theme I built for my website [Kernix Web Design](https://kernixwebdesign.com/ 'Kernix Web Design Home'). I will update this readme file later. I would not recommend downloaded and then uploading this theme for your website unless you know CSS. I have the theme header and footr colors hardcoded in the main CSS file.

## Important Notes

I removed files that were part of the Underscores download but are not required for my theme to run. They are throwing errors in my GitHub repo because of the dependencies. Here is what I removed

- `.eslintrc`: extends `plugin:@wordpress/eslint-plugin/esnext`
- `gitignore`: No need for this right now since I deleted `node_modules` ans `package.json`.
- `.stylelintrc.json`: not worth covering the few things in this file
- `composer.json`: I may need this back becuse I used a command to create the `style-rtl.css` file.
- `composer.phar`: empty file
- `package.json` and `package.lock.json`: not using node modules

Check out the notes on `composer` at the bottom of `README_S.md` on composer. I may need to install composer as I make changes to my styles so that they are reflected in `style-rtl.css`.

You can also check the [Underscores repo](https://github.com/Automattic/underscores.me) to see their files, or download a version from [their website](https://underscores.me/) t get a copy of those files.
