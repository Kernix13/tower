# Tower - Custom WordPress Theme

This is a WordPress theme built using Underscores. I use it on my website [Kernix Web Design](https://kernixwebdesign.com/) and you would not want to copy this theme and use it for yourself.

## To Do Items

1. ðŸ“Œ âœ… HOME: New Logo - ehh, it's okay
2. âœ… HOME: Add gradient to service cards
3. âœ… HOME: Fix other services
4. âœ… HOME: Add client testimonials section at end
5. âœ… Make edits to services page
6. âœ… Custom header.php for front-page (`header-home.php`)

- I can't use `site-header` and `site-brand-header`

7. âœ… Update repo theme with the local theme and upload it to the live site
8. ðŸ“Œ enqueue Font Awesome - , not workinghad to use a plugin - WTF - slowing my site
9. âœ… enqueue Google Fonts - slowing my site
10. ðŸ“Œ Download Google fonts and Font Awesome and add to fonts folder then enqueue?
11. ðŸ“Œ Skip to main content - fix
12. ðŸ“Œ Hamburger SUX!
13. ðŸ“Œ Site looks way better but still issues everywhere
14. ðŸ“Œ Console Errors:

- 2 for woocommerce.css mime type being wrong - I deleted all woocommerce files and functions
- 1 for `Uncaught ReferenceError: wp is not defined` - I assume in reference to the prefix `$wp_` - do I need to replace with my textdomain?
