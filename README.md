# Tower - Custom WordPress Theme

This is a WordPress theme built using Underscores. I use it on my website [Kernix Web Design](https://kernixwebdesign.com/) and it's custom built for my site - you would not want to use it for yourself.

## To Do Items

1. ðŸ“Œ âœ… HOME: New Logo - ehh, it's okay - new one again, better but bad font
2. ðŸ“Œ âœ… Different header.php files for different template files

- I used a conditional in header-custom.php which covers every template file that my theme uses

3. ðŸ“Œ âœ… Enqueue Font Awesome - not working, slowing my site, should I use `wp_print_scripts`?
4. ðŸ“Œ âœ… Site looks way better but still needs tweaks to the styling and content here and there
5. ðŸ“Œ Console Error:

- ðŸ“Œ 1 for `Uncaught ReferenceError: wp is not defined` in customizer.php - I assume in reference to the prefix `$wp_` - do I need to replace with my textdomain?

7. ðŸ“Œ ONGOING Update repo theme with the theme here and push to live site
