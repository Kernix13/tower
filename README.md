# Tower - Custom WordPress Theme

This is a WordPress theme built using Underscores. I use it on my website [Kernix Web Design](https://kernixwebdesign.com/) and you would not want to copy this theme and use it for yourself.

## To Do Items

1. ðŸ“Œ âœ… HOME: New Logo - ehh, it's okay

3. âœ… HOME: Fix other services
